# Amazon_top50_books

The Dataset on Amazon's Top 50 bestselling books from 2009 to 2019. Contains 550 books, data has been categorized into fiction and non-fiction using Goodreads.
I used Python and Matplotlib to analyse the data. 

This EDA gives us an overview of how much information can be gathered from even from a small dataset as above. 
As the final note we see repetition in some of the author's and title's bestselling status.
